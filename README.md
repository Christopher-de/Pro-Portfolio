## User Story

I am a astudent with the UCLA Extention, and this is a project to develope and deploy a webesite that i have built from scratch. Using my knowledge from the first 2 weeks of bootcamp, I built the framework of the website with the new teachings of html and advanced css techniques.

## Description

The goal was to implement newly acquired skills with css and html to develope a professional portfolio that will be built upon throughout the bootcamp.
